# Hello! I am Zhijie Chen.
I am an undergraduate at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. As a student majoring in AI, I am particularly interested in mathematics.

## Current Studying Focus
- Deep Learning
- Mathematics
  - Abstract Algebra
  - Differential Geometry (classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces, rather than modern differential geometry of manifolds)
  - Linear Algebra, revisited
  - Calculus, revisited
