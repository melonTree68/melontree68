# Hello! I am Zhijie Chen.
I am an undergraduate at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. As a student majoring in AI, I am particularly interested in mathematics.

## Study Interests and Focus
Current:
- Deep Learning
- Mathematics
  - Abstract Algebra
  - Differential Geometry (classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces, rather than modern differential geometry of manifolds)
  - Linear Algebra, revisited
  - Calculus, revisited

Planned in the (predictable) future:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Mathematics
  - Mathematical Logic
  - Measure Theory
  - Real Analysis
  - Probability Theory (based upon measure theory)
  - Stochastic Processes

As you can see, there is a long way to travel through, very very long ...
